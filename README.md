## FAQ

#### Why plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript? Why not \<fancy framework\>?

Honestly, although frameworks have their own merits, I believe that as a web developer, it's good to
maintain the fundamental skills. Fall back on that good old sugar, spice and everything nice. Plus,
web standards have evolved so much by now, it's actually kind of sort of a joy to write the vanilla
stuff!

Plus, this portfolio website is too simple to warrant anything big. Or at least, I'm keeping it that
way!

#### Do you hate frameworks?

No - of course not. Frameworks are awesome! There exists a wide variety to solve an even wider
variety of technical challenges. For a static site of which the content needs to be managed by a
CMS, why not try Gatsby or Astro? For a dashboard-type app, why not use React, or Vue, or Angular?
And for a simple portfolio without too much content that is maintained by yours truly, why not try
vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript?
